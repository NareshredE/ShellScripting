# ShellScripting
Shell Scripting is here


echo $SHELL -- will give you the which shell we are using. Here SHELL is variable name and it should be uppercase
For example if it gives "/bin/bash" - that means you are using bash shell

# Let's write one executable file 

every executable file(bash) should start with below command 

#!/bin/bash

if you want to comment in shell script add # symbol so that shell will not execute that particular row
For example - #I'm writing this to explain how to comment a line in shell scripting

few commands that are useful in day to day operations : 

ls -- list out all files and directories
ls - l -- list our number of files and it's permissions
